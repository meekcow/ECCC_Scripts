# ECCC_Scripts
Learning to use python 2.7 as a scripting tool and an attempt to develop a toolbox (as part of Co-op in 2018)

### Description
These small projects were a self-initiative to try a learn more about programming and problem solving :)

### Contents
Formatcsv was used to format a raw csv file from a website into a mappable csv file for ArcMap

Tools and toolbox were learning projects aimed at creating a small application toolbox with various script functionalities (such as directory searching, converting units, etc)
Ended up with an applet but the functionality hasn't been implemented

### WIP
Future steps: Possible conversion of code to python 3 and then continue working on it
